# PTCG Check Friend Macro for Macrodroid

This macro have been designed to work with **Arturo's PTCGPB** and works only on **Android**

I tested it with 2 phones with different resolutions so it should work on yours too, here is a video showing it in action :

This macro can be used to automatically check for new friends and add them as they appear
To avoid spamming server request the macro refresh the social hun every 4-6 seconds so you should specifiy a waiting time around 10-15s 
It works using random timing variation when clicking buttons to be a bit safer

# Installation

- First you need to install macrodroid
- Download the .macro on the repo on your phone then choose to execute with MacroDroid
- You'll be prompted to change permissions so Macrodroid can do stuff on his own like emulating clicks on your screen, feel free to analyze the code before, it's not that much long
- At this time it requires you to change your device screen resolution (look at the 2 firsts lines when you load the macro) :
- On the bottom right you should see a button with a "+", click it until it does not ask you to change permissions anymore
- Start PocketTCG and click the little "Check" icon
- To stop it, increase the volume

# Issues

Feel free to increase the waiting times if your phone is pretty slow when opening menus

If it does not manage to check when a new friend appears, dm me on discord your screen resolution (username : thobi)
